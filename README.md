## About

- ‚ñ∂ _How to play?_ - App gonna give you a word (only you know the word), then you have to draw this up - others have to guess. If they guess your drawing you gonna get a score as well as the person who guessed it gonna get score too.

### How to use?

This is currently being in development, so to use this you have to clone the repository. After cloning this make sure you've installed all dependencies. Then, go to server folder and in terminal run `yarn dev` and quit from server and go to client folder and run the exact same command. The script in client folder will run localhost:3000 but that's not what we need. Insted, go to localhost:5000 and click on `‚ñ∂` button. That's it. Go to exact same direcory in other tab and draw - you will see instant changes in two tabs.
