### How to use?

This is currently being in development, so to use this you have to clone the repository. After cloning this make sure you've installed all dependencies. Then, run `yarn dev` in and go to client folder and run the exact same command. The script in client folder will run localhost:3000 but that's not what we need. Insted, go to localhost:5000. Boom, there you go.
